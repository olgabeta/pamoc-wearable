# PAMoC project

For this course, we were asked to come up with an original idea to tackle a healthcare issue using embedded systems.
Our solution was a wearable device that recognizes, deals with and reports panic attacks, P.A.Mo.C. (Panic Attack Monitor and Control).

Due to COVID-19, we took this course online and didn't have access to the material (Arduino board, sensors, etc.), so the code has not been tested in real life and therefore may contain basic errors.
